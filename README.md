## Part 1: Data Storage

### 5.1 SQLite
- Used `TaskDatabaseHelper` to manage a local `tasks` table.
- Fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `isCompleted`.
- Core operations: `insertTask`, `updateTask`, `deleteTask`, `getAllTasks`.
- Robust error handling when performing database operations.

### 5.2 SharedPreferences
- Theme preference stored via SharedPreferences.
- Users can toggle between light and dark themes in `SettingsActivity`.
- The selected theme is applied every time the app is launched.

## Part 2: RecyclerView and Custom Adapters

### 6.1 Dynamic Lists
- `RecyclerView` displays all tasks in real time.
- When a task is added, updated, or deleted, the list updates automatically.

### 6.2 Custom Adapter
- Custom `TaskAdapter` displays:
    - Task title
    - Description
    - Completion checkbox
    - Delete button
- Efficient ViewHolder pattern and click listeners.
